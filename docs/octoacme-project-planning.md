# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
   - **UX Designer**: Provide design requirements, mockups, and user flow dependencies
   - **QA Lead**: Review acceptance criteria for testability and quality standards
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
   - Include design review, QA sign-off, and deployment readiness criteria
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
   - **DevOps Engineer**: Flag infrastructure or deployment dependencies
6. Create release plan and milestone map
   - **DevOps Engineer**: Confirm deployment windows and infrastructure readiness

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Design required: (Yes/No - if yes, UX Designer involved)
- QA approach: (Unit/Integration/E2E/Manual)

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
